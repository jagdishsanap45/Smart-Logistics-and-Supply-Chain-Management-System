Project-> Smart Logistics and Supply Chain Management System

🧠 What is the Problem We Are Solving?
Big companies have:

Warehouses full of products

Vendors supplying new stock

Delivery teams sending items to customers or other locations

Managers who monitor all this with dashboards

👉 We will build this system using your Java + Spring Boot + AWS + DevOps skills.
===========================================================================================================================

🚧 What Will Our Project Do?
We will create multiple microservices to manage:

Service Name	What it does
Inventory Service----------	Keeps track of products in stock, their quantity, and locations in warehouses.
Order Service--------------	Accepts internal/external orders and processes them (just like a Flipkart backend).
Delivery Service-----------	Assigns deliveries, updates delivery status, and tracks shipment progress.
Vendor Service-------------	Manages vendors who supply products, restocking, and vendor performance.
Notification Service-------	Sends email/SMS notifications via AWS SNS when order is placed/delivered.
Analytics Service----------	Dashboards to monitor top products, vendor delays, delivery time, etc.
Auth Service--------------	Handles login, roles (Admin, Manager), and JWT-based security.
============================================================================================================================

🧱 Architecture (Simple Plan)
We'll break the app into independent services like this:

[Gateway (optional)]
      ↓
[Auth Service]
      ↓
───────────────
↓     ↓     ↓
Order  Inventory  Vendor
↓     ↓     ↓
Delivery   Notification  Analytics

==============================================================================================================================
Each service:

Has its own database

Communicates via REST or Kafka

Is deployable separately (on AWS EC2)

Will be documented using Swagger

=========================================================================================================================
🧪 Example Use Case Flow (Real-World Simulation)
Use case: New Order is placed

Order Service receives the request to place an order.

It checks with Inventory Service if the item is available.

If yes, order is placed and stock is reduced.

Kafka sends an event: “New Order Placed”.

Delivery Service receives this event → assigns a delivery agent.

Notification Service sends SMS/email update to the manager.

Analytics Service logs this for reporting.
====================================================================================================================================
🛠️ What Technologies Will Be Used Where?

Skill	Where You'll Use It

Java + Spring Boot	Building all microservices
Spring Security + JWT	Auth Service
Kafka	Event flow between Order → Delivery → Notification
Redis	Caching product stock info
MySQL	Each service's relational database
Jenkins	CI/CD pipeline to deploy code to AWS
SonarQube	Code quality checks
AWS EC2, RDS, S3	Deploy each microservice
Swagger	API documentation
Terraform (Optional)	Infrastructure automation

Communication Plan Between Services

From → To	Type	Why
Gateway → Auth Service		Synchronous (REST)	For login/signup, we need instant response
Gateway → Other Services	Synchronous (REST)	User requests pass through the API gateway
Order → Inventory		Synchronous (REST)	Need to check stock before placing order
Order → Delivery		Asynchronous (Kafka)	Delivery is triggered after placing order
Order → Notification		Asynchronous (Kafka)	Send order confirmation message
Vendor → Inventory		Synchronous (REST)	Update stock when vendor sends products
Analytics → All (esp. Order/Delivery)	Asynchronous (Kafka Consumer)	Analytics just listens to all events
Notification → SNS (AWS)	Asynchronous	SNS sends emails/SMS in background
